# Monolithic Architecture #


**Objectives**

- Monolithic means --> formed of a single large block of stone.
- large,indivisible and slow change.

- self contained - packaged and deployed as single unit.
- it has 3 application layers
	 
         1.presentation layer

       	2.Application layer

	     3.Data layer

**Advantages**

1) It has only one single unit of deployment.

**Disadvantages**

1)often very large

2)Technology dependency on initial decisions

3)Implemented using single development stack.

4)frequent deployments are not practical.

5)need to scale entire application stack.

----------



#Micro Services Architecture


1) Micro service is a smaller and multiple components services which are built to handle a very specific concerns.

2)these are managed by a involved self contained teams

3)Multiple services makeup application

**Note**:

"Application should be easy to deploy, then scaleup and scaledown dependencies" 

**Characteristics of Micro Services**

1) **Autonomous**:
It is developed,deployed,operated and scaled without affecting the other micro services


2) **Specialized**:
	It is designed to solve a specific business problems.

**Advantages**:

1) Flexible scaling

2)Easy Deployment

3)Technological Freedom

4)Reusable code.

5)Resilience

**Disadvantages**:

1)Spawning

2)Maintenance

3)Duplicate code

4)Network performance
