Azure SQL Database - Pricing options

Azure SQL Database offers several pricing options depending on your needs for performance, flexibility, and management. Here’s an overview of the main pricing tiers:

1. DTU-based (Database Transaction Unit) Model
This older model is based on a bundled measure of compute, storage, and IO. You can choose from different tiers, each with a specific DTU allocation.

Basic: Suitable for small databases with a single workload.

Maximum database size: 2 GB
Suitable for light workloads (e.g., basic apps or small websites)
Standard: Provides moderate performance.

DTU options: 10–300 DTUs

Maximum database size: Up to 1 TB

Suitable for general-purpose applications
Premium: Provides high performance and is designed for mission-critical applications.
DTU options: 125–4000 DTUs
Maximum database size: Up to 4 TB


2. vCore-based (Virtual Core) Model

The vCore model allows you to choose CPU, memory, and storage independently. It provides more flexibility compared to the DTU model.

General Purpose: Balanced for most workloads, offering scalable compute and storage.
Compute: Up to 80 vCores

Storage: Up to 16 TB

Suitable for general business applications

Business Critical: High-performance and designed for mission-critical workloads.

Compute: Up to 80 vCores

Storage: Up to 4 TB
Offers built-in HA with multiple replicas

Hyperscale: Scalable storage and compute designed for very large databases.

Compute: Up to 80 vCores

Storage: Virtually unlimited (up to 100 TB)


3. Serverless
Automatically pauses during inactivity and scales up/down based on usage.
Pay only for the compute resources you use.
Ideal for intermittent workloads.


4. Elastic Pool
Shared resources across multiple databases within a pool.
Allows cost savings by optimizing resource utilization when databases have varying resource usage.

Key Factors Affecting Pricing

Storage: Pay for storage based on the amount used (in the vCore model, storage is billed separately).

Backup: Backup storage is free up to 100% of the database size, and beyond that, there are charges for long-term backup retention.

Network Egress: Data egress (data leaving Azure) may incur additional costs.
