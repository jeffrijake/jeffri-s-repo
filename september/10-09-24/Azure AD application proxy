Azure AD application proxy



It is a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables secure remote access to on-premises web applications. It allows users to access internal applications, like SharePoint, intranet sites, or custom web applications, from anywhere using Azure AD authentication, without the need for a VPN or direct access to the corporate network.

Key Features of Azure AD Application Proxy:

Secure Remote Access:

Provides secure, remote access to on-premises web applications by acting as a reverse proxy.
Users can access internal apps from any device or location using Azure AD credentials, with no need to expose internal networks directly to the internet.

Azure AD Integration:

Supports Single Sign-On (SSO) for seamless authentication. Users log in once using their Azure AD credentials and gain access to both cloud and on-premises applications.
Integrates with Conditional Access policies, enforcing security requirements such as multifactor authentication (MFA), location-based access control, and device compliance before granting access.

No VPN Required:

Unlike traditional solutions like VPNs, Application Proxy eliminates the need for users to connect to the corporate network directly.
Reduces the management overhead of maintaining VPNs while improving security by minimizing attack surface exposure.

Pre-Authentication:

Azure AD Application Proxy provides pre-authentication through Azure AD, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access internal applications.
It supports additional security measures such as MFA and passwordless authentication methods.

Application Connectors:

Uses lightweight connectors installed on the on-premises environment to establish a secure outbound connection to Azure.
The connectors handle all traffic between Azure AD and on-premises applications, ensuring a secure communication path.

Supports Diverse Application Types:

Compatible with many types of applications, including those that use Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) or header-based authentication.
Can be used for custom web applications, legacy applications, and even rich-client apps that are hosted internally.

Conditional Access and Security Controls:

Enforce security policies like MFA, location-based access, and risk-based authentication when users attempt to access the on-premises apps through Azure AD Application Proxy.
Use Azure AD Conditional Access to ensure that only compliant devices or users from trusted locations can access critical internal resources.

Access Control and Monitoring:

Provides detailed audit logs and access control insights, enabling administrators to track who accessed which applications, when, and from where.
Helps with compliance and monitoring by providing centralized control over application access and activity.



How Azure AD Application Proxy Works:

User Request:

The user accesses an internal web application via a public URL that is routed through Azure AD.

Pre-Authentication:

Azure AD verifies the user's identity using pre-authentication mechanisms (e.g., username, password, MFA).

Application Proxy Connector:

Once authenticated, Azure AD forwards the request to the Application Proxy Connector, which resides on the on-premises network. The connector establishes a secure connection between Azure and the internal app.

Application Response:

The proxy connector forwards the user's request to the application server on-premises and sends the response back to the user via the secure channel.
