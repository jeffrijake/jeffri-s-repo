Azure Premium Storage Accounts

Azure Premium Storage Accounts are optimized for high-performance storage workloads, providing low-latency and high-throughput disk storage for Azure virtual machines (VMs). Hereâ€™s an overview:

Types of Azure Premium Storage:

Premium SSD Managed Disks (P30, P40, etc.):

High-performance, low-latency SSD-backed storage designed for I/O-intensive applications.
Suitable for large databases, OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems, or other mission-critical workloads.

Premium SSD v2 Disks:

Next-gen premium SSD, offering better flexibility, performance, and cost control for workloads requiring higher performance.
Premium Page Blobs (Premium Storage Accounts):

Suitable for Azure VMs to support high-performance workloads.
Ideal for SQL Server, NoSQL databases, and big data analytics workloads.

Ultra Disks:

Extremely low-latency, high-throughput disks ideal for mission-critical workloads such as SAP HANA, top-tier databases, and advanced big data analytics.

Key Benefits:

Low Latency: Provides sub-millisecond latency, ideal for workloads requiring fast response times.

High Throughput: Supports high IOPS and throughput requirements.
Consistency: Provides consistent high performance across reads and writes.

Scalability: Allows you to scale performance based on storage size.

Use Cases:

Large databases like Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle.

SAP applications.

High-performance, data-intensive applications.

Limitations:
Higher cost compared to Standard storage accounts.
Only supports certain VM types and configurations optimized for premium storage.
