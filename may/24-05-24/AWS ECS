Amazon ECS:

It is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.It's integrated with both AWS and third-party tools, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry and Docker. This integration makes it easier for teams to focus on building the applications, not the environment.

Key Features of ECS:

Managed Cluster: 

	ECS manages a cluster of EC2 instances or Fargate tasks, enabling you to schedule and run containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

Task Definition: 
	A task definition is a blueprint for your application, describing one or more containers (up to ten) that form your application. You define the Docker image, CPU, memory, port mappings, and other settings in a JSON file.

Service Management: 
	ECS allows you to create services that enable you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition. It ensures that the desired number of tasks are running and replaces tasks if they fail or stop.

Scheduling: 
	ECS provides several scheduling options to run your containerized applications, including:


	Service Scheduler: For long-running applications and services.

	Batch Scheduler: For running batch jobs.

	Custom Scheduler: Using the ECS API, you can build your custom scheduler to meet specific needs.

ECS Launch Types:

EC2 Launch Type: 
	You manage the cluster of EC2 instances that run your containers. You have control over the EC2 instances, including choosing instance types and sizes, and you can use Spot Instances to reduce costs.

Fargate Launch Type: 
	You do not manage the underlying infrastructure. AWS handles the provisioning and scaling of compute resources. This is a serverless option, ideal for running containers without managing servers.

Getting Started with ECS:

Create a Cluster: 
	Start by creating an ECS cluster which can be backed by EC2 instances or use Fargate.

Define a Task: 
	Create a task definition specifying the Docker image and the resources needed.

Create a Service: 
	Deploy a service to ensure a specified number of task instances are running.

Monitor and Scale: 
	Use CloudWatch and ECS Service Auto Scaling to monitor and adjust the number of running instances.
