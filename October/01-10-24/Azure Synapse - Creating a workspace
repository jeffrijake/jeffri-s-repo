To create an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, follow these steps:

Steps to Create an Azure Synapse Workspace:

Prerequisites:
An active Azure subscription.
Appropriate permissions (Owner or Contributor role) to create resources in the Azure portal.

Step 1: Sign in to the Azure Portal
Go to Azure Portal and sign in with your Azure account.

Step 2: Navigate to Azure Synapse Analytics
In the Azure Portal, search for "Azure Synapse Analytics" in the search bar and select it from the dropdown.

Step 3: Create a Synapse Workspace
In the Azure Synapse Analytics page, click the "Create" button.

On the Basics tab:

Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.

Resource Group: Select an existing resource group or create a new one.

Workspace Name: Enter a unique name for your Synapse workspace.

Region: Choose the Azure region where you want to deploy the workspace (this is important for performance and compliance).
Storage Account: Select or create a new Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. This will act as your workspaceâ€™s primary data storage.
File System: Name the file system for your Data Lake (typically synapse or similar).

Click Next: Security.

Step 4: Configure Security Settings

On the Security tab:

Managed Identity: By default, Synapse creates a system-assigned managed identity for the workspace to access other Azure resources securely.
Data Encryption: Optionally, you can specify customer-managed keys for encryption if required.
You can also choose to connect the workspace to a Virtual Network (VNet) for additional security.

Click Next: Networking.

Step 5: Configure Networking Settings (Optional)
If required, configure networking settings like enabling a virtual network (VNet), managed private endpoints, and data exfiltration protection.

Click Next: Tags.

Step 6: Add Tags (Optional)

You can add tags to your workspace (key-value pairs) for better organization and billing tracking.

Click Next: Review + Create.

Step 7: Review and Create the Workspace

Review all your workspace configuration settings.

Once everything looks good, click the "Create" button to deploy the Synapse workspace.

The deployment process will take a few minutes. Once completed, you will receive a notification.

Step 8: Access Your Synapse Workspace
After the deployment is finished, navigate to the resource group or the Synapse workspace itself.

Click "Go to resource" to access the Synapse workspace.

You will be taken to Azure Synapse Studio, where you can start working with your workspace, create SQL pools, Spark pools, data pipelines, and more.
