Verifying task connectivity:


	There are times when a task stops because of a network connectivity issue. It might be an intermittent issue, but it is most likely caused because the task cannot connect to an endpoint.


You can use AWSSupport-TroubleshootECSTaskFailedToStart runbook to test the task connectivity. When you use the runbook, you need the following resource information:

	1) The task ID Use the ID of the most recent failed task.

	2) The cluster that the task was in.


The runbook analyzes the task. You can view the results in the Output section for the following issues that can prevent a task from starting:

	1) Network connectivity to the configured container registry

	2) VPC endpoint connectivity

	3) Security group rule configuration
