Azure Governance Management Groups:


Management Groups are essential for organizations with large Azure environments, providing a scalable way to manage governance and compliance across multiple subscriptions.


Azure Governance Management Groups are a feature within Microsoft Azure that allows you to organize your resources and enforce policies across your Azure environment at a large scale. 


Here's an overview of how they work:

1. Hierarchical Structure:

	Management Groups sit at the top of the Azure resource hierarchy, above subscriptions.
	You can create a hierarchy of management groups to reflect your organizational structure, such as departments, teams, or business units.

2. Policy Enforcement:

	Management Groups allow you to apply Azure Policies, Azure Blueprints, and role-based access control (RBAC) across multiple subscriptions.
	By applying policies at the management group level, you can enforce compliance and governance standards consistently across your organization.

3. Inheritance:

	Resources within a subscription inherit the policies and RBAC assignments applied at the management group level.
	This inheritance simplifies governance by ensuring that all child resources follow the policies of their parent management group.

4. Centralized Management:
	
	With management groups, you can manage governance at scale, ensuring that your entire Azure environment adheres to corporate policies, security standards, and best practices.
	This centralized control helps reduce risks and ensures that resources are deployed and managed in a consistent manner.

5. Use Cases:

	Enterprise-Wide Compliance: Ensure that all resources comply with legal, regulatory, and corporate standards.

Resource Organization: Group subscriptions that belong to different departments or projects, applying specific policies relevant to those areas.

Cost Management: Apply cost management policies and budgets across different management groups to control spending.
