Azure multiple subscripitions and when to use multiple subscripitions:


multiple Azure subscriptions are typically used for organizational, management, and security purposes in large or complex environments. Properly implemented, they can provide clear benefits in terms of resource organization, cost management, and compliance.

Azure subscriptions are a way to organize and manage resources within Microsoft Azure. Having multiple subscriptions can help manage resources, billing, security, and compliance in large or complex environments.

Hereâ€™s when and why we might want to use multiple Azure subscriptions:

1. Separation of Environments:

Development, Testing, and Production: Use different subscriptions for development, testing, and production environments. This separation ensures that resources in one environment do not affect those in another and can help with cost management and security.

Isolation for Different Teams: Different teams or departments can have their own subscriptions, allowing them to manage their resources independently without affecting others.


2. Resource and Cost Management:

Cost Tracking: Using separate subscriptions for different projects, departments, or clients makes it easier to track and allocate costs. Azure's cost management tools allow you to monitor spending at the subscription level.

Resource Limits: Each Azure subscription has resource limits (e.g., number of VMs, storage accounts). Having multiple subscriptions can help you work around these limits by spreading resources across several subscriptions.


3. Security and Compliance:

Access Control: You can implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) and policies at the subscription level. This ensures that only authorized users have access to specific resources.

Compliance Requirements: Different subscriptions can be configured to meet specific compliance requirements for different regions or workloads. This is particularly useful for companies operating in multiple geographic regions with varying data protection laws.

4. Billing and Payment Separation:

Separate Billing Accounts: Each subscription can be tied to a different billing account or payment method, which is useful for organizations that need to manage expenses across multiple business units or for projects with separate budgets.

Cost Centers: You can create subscriptions that align with different cost centers within your organization, making it easier to attribute and manage costs.

5. Organizational Structure and Governance:

Subsidiaries or Divisions: Large enterprises with multiple subsidiaries or divisions can use different subscriptions to manage resources independently while maintaining a unified Azure environment.

Azure Management Groups: Multiple subscriptions can be organized under Azure Management Groups, allowing you to apply policies and manage access across many subscriptions at once.


6. Avoiding Subscription Sprawl:

Subscription Lifecycle Management: While multiple subscriptions can provide better management and control, it's important to manage them effectively to avoid subscription sprawl, where too many subscriptions make management complex.


7. Global and Regional Considerations:

Multi-Region Deployments: Use different subscriptions for different geographic regions to manage resources closer to end users, adhere to local data sovereignty laws, and optimize performance.
