Now we to create container from our own image, therefore we are create a container:

	docker run --it --name jeffriexample ubuntu /bin/bash


Now we need to create a new file in tmp directory

	mkdir tmp
	cd tmp/

	touch file

to check the images in docker 
	
	docker images


Docker file:
	
	It is a text file which contains some set of instructions

components in docker file:

1) From: for base image, this command must be on top of the dockerfile.

2) RUN: To execute commands,it will crate a layer in image

3) Maintainer: Author (or) Owner (or) Description

4) Copy: Copy files from Local System (we need to provide source,destination)

5) ADD: Similar to copy but, it provides a feature to download files from internet, also we extract file at docker image side.

6) EXPOSE: to expose ports such as port 8080 for tomcat, port 80 for nginx etc

7) WORDDIR: to set working directory for a container

8) CMD: execute commands but during container creation 

9) ENTRYPOINT: Similar to CMD but has higher priority over CMD, first command will be executed by entrypoint only.

10) ENV: Envirnomental variables 





1) Creating one Dockerfile

	vi Dockerfile (D should be capital)

2) create one docker file

FROM ubuntu
RUN echo "hello this is an example dockerfile" > /tmp/examplefile

3) execute the docker file

	docker build -t test .
