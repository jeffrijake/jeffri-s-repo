Git is a "version control system"

Github is used to store the source code.


Fork:

To get own copy of our repository

Difference between branch and tag:


1)Branch
	
	a) it is mutable
	b) inline development we create branch

2) Tag

	a) it is immutable
	b) In production development we create tag


difference between git revert and git reset:

Git Revert:

	It will delete the updated information and also all commit id's

Git Reset:

	It will move all files to tagging area to working area


difference between git merge and git rebase:

Git Merge:

	Integrate code from one branch to another

Git rebase:
	
	Integrate code from one branch to another


Github areas:


1) Working area:

	Whatever files we created it will be available in working area

2) Staging area:

	It is a place we have to keep the updated files

3) local area:

	First develop the code and store in this

4) Remote area:

	Github


commands in git:

1) git --version --> to display the git version

2)git add filename --> particular files moves to working area to staging area

3)git config --global --list --> displays all username and email id's


4)git branch -d branchname --> delete the branch only in local area

5)git clean --> it will clean all files whatever in working area

6)git log --> displays all commit id's

5)git show command id --> how many files added in particular commits

6)git branch -r --> displays all remote branches

7)git chechout branchname --> it will switch to other branch

8)git chechout -b branchname --> it will switch to other branch by creating the branch


Tags: 

1)git tag: it will create a tag

2)git tag --all: it will display all tags



1) Git stash --> in working area it will takes backups as temporary storage

2) git stash list --> it display backup stash list
